We will be using a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018) that tracks 200+ financial indicators (obtained from SEC 10-K filings) of 4000+ companies from 2014 to 2018. These indicators are multifaceted, and they span the range of company earnings, expenses and inventory. To obtain month-on-month stock performance from 2014 to 2018, we will scrape such data from the [Nasdaq website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks) and join it to the Kaggle dataset.
We intend to find how we can use a companyâ€™s financial indicators to determine if its stock is worth buying?
